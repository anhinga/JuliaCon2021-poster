# Materials related to my virtual poster at JuliaCon 2021

My poster proposal for JuliaCon 2021

# Multiplying monochrome images as matrices: A*B and softmax

https://github.com/anhinga/julia-notebooks/blob/main/images-as-matrices/presentation/talk-proposal.md

has been accepted. Now it's time to prepare a 3 minute video (June 30 deadline), and
to assemble all relevant materials together by the time of presentation (July 28-30 range).

At the moment, we have quite a bit of work-in-progress materials spread across several repositories;
so this repository is for getting a more compact and streamlines presentation.
