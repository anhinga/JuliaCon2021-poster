https://github.com/anhinga/julia-notebooks/blob/main/images-as-matrices/presentation/commentary.md

has been accepted. A 3 minute cover video for this virtual poster and the slide deck associated with this video can be found in the `slides-and-video` subdirectory.

The links to our current efforts in this direction can be found here:

A number of auxiliary studies (scale invariance, modifications of `softmax` formulas, and such) are
referenced in the README here: https://github.com/anhinga/julia-notebooks/tree/main/images-as-matrices

I am planning to use this repository to organize a more streamlined and systematic presentation
of this material by the time of JuliaCon 2021 (July 28-30).
