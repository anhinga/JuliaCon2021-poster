https://github.com/anhinga/julia-notebooks/blob/main/images-as-matrices/presentation/commentary.md

has been accepted. A 3 minute cover video for this virtual poster and the slide deck associated with this video can be found in the `slides-and-video` subdirectory.

The links to our current efforts in this direction can be found here:

Slides 1-4 of the slide deck correspond to

https://github.com/anhinga/julia-notebooks/blob/main/images-as-matrices/presentation/commentary.md

Slide 5 of the slide deck corresponds to `variations-4` notebook here (to the last
computation of its directed acycled dataflow graph of image transformations):

The machine learning part of the slide deck corresponds to `may-23-switch-to-adam.ipynb` notebook here:

A number of auxiliary studies (scale invariance, modifications of `softmax` formulas, and such) are
referenced in the README here: https://github.com/anhinga/julia-notebooks/tree/main/images-as-matrices

I am planning to use this repository to organize a more streamlined and systematic presentation
of this material by the time of JuliaCon 2021 (July 28-30).
