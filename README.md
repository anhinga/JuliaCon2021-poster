# Multiplying monochrome images as matrices: A*B and softmax

# (Materials related to my virtual poster at JuliaCon 2021)

I obtained images like

![symmetric](symmetric.png)

and

![asymmetric](asymmetric.png)

via matrix multiplication.

My poster proposal for JuliaCon 2021

https://github.com/anhinga/julia-notebooks/blob/main/images-as-matrices/presentation/talk-proposal.md

https://github.com/anhinga/julia-notebooks/blob/main/images-as-matrices/presentation/commentary.md

has been accepted. A 3 minute cover video for this virtual poster and the slide deck associated with this video can be found in the `slides-and-video` subdirectory.

The links to our current efforts in this direction can be found here:

https://github.com/anhinga/2021-notes/blob/main/matrix-mult-machines/README.md

Slides 1-4 of the slide deck correspond to

https://github.com/anhinga/julia-notebooks/blob/main/images-as-matrices/presentation/commentary.md

Slide 5 of the slide deck corresponds to `variations-4` notebook here (more specifically,
it corresponds to the last computation of the directed acycled dataflow graph of
image transformations in this notebook which composes
matrix multiplications with other image transformations):

The machine learning part of the slide deck corresponds to `may-23-switch-to-adam.ipynb` notebook here:

https://github.com/anhinga/julia-notebooks/tree/main/flux-may-2021

A number of auxiliary studies (scale invariance, modifications of `softmax` formulas, and such) are
referenced in the README here: https://github.com/anhinga/julia-notebooks/tree/main/images-as-matrices

I'll keep editing this repository to improve presentation
of this and related material till the time of JuliaCon 2021 poster session (July 30).
