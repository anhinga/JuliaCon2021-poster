I have conducted some experiments for this RFP using Compact Transformers:

_Escaping the Big Data Paradigm with Compact Transformers_: https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05704

PyTorch implementation: https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Compact-Transformers

I used a mid-late August version captured in my fork: https://github.com/anhinga/Compact-Transformers

The experiments are rather inconclusive so far, but I am going to document them here.
